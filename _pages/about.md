I am a PhD Student at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes (UGA) in co-supervision by UGA and the Athena Research Center (ARC), and a research associate at ARC, under the supervision of Dr. Georgia Koutrika and Prof. Sihem Amer-Yahia.
My work focuses on using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to make data open and accessible to users without technical knowledge and is part of the <a href="http://www.inode-project.eu/">INODE</a> and <a href="http://www.faircore4eosc.eu/">FAIR Core 4 EOSC</a> projects, funded by the EU.
During the past few years, my work has resulted in 5 tutorials presented at major conferences [<a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_edbt21/">EDBT'21</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_sigmod21/">SIGMOD'21</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_twc22/">TWC'22</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/datadem_wsdm23/">WSDM'23</a>, <a href="/tutorials/nlidbs_vldb23/">VLDB'23</a>], one query explanation system [<a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/systems/eqsplain/">eQsplain</a>] that has been integrated into the INODE project, and a survey studying the fast-paced research area of deep learning text-to-SQL [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-022-00776-8">VLDBJ'23</a>].

My MSc degree was in Data Science and Information Technologies, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, at the University of Athens.
My MSc thesis is titled _"Data Democratisation with Deep Learning: Structured Query Translation from and to Natural Language"_.
Before that, I was studying towards my BSc degree in Computer Science at the University of Athens, where I completed my BSc thesis, titled _"Translating Natural Language to SQL using Deep Learning"_.
