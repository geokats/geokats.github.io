I am a PhD Student at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes (UGA) in co-supervision by UGA and Athena Research Center (ARC), under the supervision of Dr. Georgia Koutrika and Dr. Sihem Amer-Yahia. I have also worked as an intern at <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/zurich">IBM Research Europe</a>. My work focuses on using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing techniques to make data open and accessible to users without technical knowledge.

During my 4+ years of research experience, my work has resulted in multiple <a href="https://geokats.github.io/publications/">publications</a> and tutorials [<a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_edbt21/">EDBT'21</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_sigmod21/">SIGMOD'21</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/text2sql_twc22/">TWC'22</a>, <a href="https://darelab.imsi.athenarc.gr/tutorials/datadem_wsdm23/">WSDM'23</a>, <a href="/tutorials/nlidbs_vldb23/">VLDB'23</a>] presented at major conferences, and has been part of EU funded projects [<a href="http://www.inode-project.eu/">INODE</a>, <a href="http://www.faircore4eosc.eu/">FAIRCORE4EOSC</a>] where I have developped and integrated systems for Data Management and NLP problems such as Text-to-SQL and Query Explanations.

Prior to my doctoral studies I obtained my MSc degree in Data Science and Information Technologies, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, from the University of Athens.
My MSc thesis is titled _"Data Democratisation with Deep Learning: Structured Query Translation from and to Natural Language"_.
Before that, I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Athens, where I completed my BSc thesis, titled _"Translating Natural Language to SQL using Deep Learning"_.
