I am working as a research assistant at the Athena Research and Innovation Center, under the supervision of Dr. Georgia Koutrika.
My work focuses on using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to make data open and accessible to users without technical knowledge, and is part of the <a href="http://www.inode-project.eu/">INODE</a> and <a href="http://www.faircore4eosc.eu/">FAIR Core 4 EOSC</a> projects, funded by the EU.
During the past two years my work has resulted in 4 tutorials presented at major conferences [<a href="/tutorials/text2sql_edbt21/">EDBT'21</a>, <a href="/tutorials/text2sql_sigmod21/">SIGMOD'21</a>, <a href="/tutorials/text2sql_twc22/">TWC'22</a>, <a href="/tutorials/datadem_wsdm23/">WSDM'23</a>], one query explanation system [<a href="/systems/eqsplain/">eQsplain</a>] that has been integrated in the INODE project, and a survey studying the fast-paced research area of deep learning text-to-SQL [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-022-00776-8">VLDBJ'23</a>].

My MSc degree was on Data Science and Information Technologies, with a specialisation on Artificial Intelligence, at the University of Athens.
My MSc thesis, is titled <i>"Data Democratisation with Deep Learning: Structured Query Translation from and to Natural Language"</i>.
Prior to that, I was studying towards my BSc degree on Computer Science at the University Athens, where I completed my BSc thesis, titled <i>"Translating Natural Language to SQL using Deep Learning"</i>.
